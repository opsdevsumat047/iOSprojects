# iOS Projects by Me 📱

Welcome to my iOS app development journey, featuring various projects that showcase my skills in Swift and Xcode.

### Featured Projects:

#### 1. Dice Rolling App 🎲
- A fun app allowing users to roll virtual dice with randomized results.
- Key skills demonstrated: interactive functionality, connecting Interface Builder with IBActions/IBOutlets, and using Swift’s constants, variables, and arrays.

#### 2. I Am Rich 💎
🚀 Excited to share my first iOS app project, "I Am Rich"! 🚀
- This app marks the beginning of my journey in iOS development. Through this project, I learned:
  - 🖼️ Positioning UI elements precisely on the screen for an intuitive user experience.
  - 📱 Inserting and customizing app icons for a professional look.
  - 🔍 Integrating icons in multiple sizes for various devices and screen resolutions.
- This project taught me the importance of attention to detail in mobile UI design.

#### 3. Magic Ball 🎱
- This app uses similar principles as the Dice Rolling app but features a cool background image.
- Users can ask a question and shake their device to receive a randomized answer.
